Perlin noise impementation modified from noise1234.c by Stefan Gustavson, 2003-2005, stefan.gustavson@liu.se, https://github.com/stegu/perlin-noise
I replaced the macros with real functions and squished things down a bit.

Usage:
-call pnoiseInit with a seed value of your choice
-call a pnoise[1,2,3] function for noise
